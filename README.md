# Micromer

This fork of Polymer aims at ultimate performance. Think of it as writing close
to vanila web components with minimum suguring. It includes the following
features from the original Polymer:

- everything in polymer-micro
- src/standard/events.html
- src/standard/utils.html
  - ../lib/async.html
  - ../lib/settings.html
  - ../lib/debounce.html
- src/standard/effectBuilder.html
  - ../lib/bind/accessors.html
  - ../lib/bind/effects.html
- src/standard/configure.html
- src/standard/notify-path.html
  - ../lib/case-map.html

 Plus the modifications @polymer-mod.html. Modifications from the original code
 are clearly marked. A major modification to note is in the `acccessors`
 sections.
